## Overview
This analysis looked at two sets of data from PyBer, a ride sharing company. The goal of the analysis for the PyBer ride data was to create a data frame with new summary statistics, and a chart showing total weekly fares by city type. The two csv files were again merged into the PyBer dataframe, which was then used to calculate the previously mentioned statistics for this data set to assist in providing recommendations for PyBer.
